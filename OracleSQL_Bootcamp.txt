*** Create user in Oracle DB ***

CREATE USER temp_user IDENTIFIED BY 123
	PASSWORD EXPIRE
	ACCOUNT [UNLOCK | LOCK]
	CONTAINER=[CURRENT | ALL];

GRANT CREATE SESSION TO temp_user;
SELECT * FROM dba_users;
SELECT * FROM all_users;
SELECT * FROM user_users;

DROP USER temp_user [CASCADE];
---------------------------------


*** Grant System Privileges ***

SELECT * FROM user_sys_privis;
SELECT * FROM dba_sys_privis;

CREATE TABLE temp_table(temp_column NUMBER);

GRANT CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW TO temp_user
	WITH ADMIN OPTION
	CONTAINER = [CURRENT | ALL];
---------------------------------------------


*** Roles & Public ***
* Instead of granting many privis to all users individually,
* we first collect a group of privis into a Role
* we then grant that specific Role to a User Group
* and assign the Users to specific Group
* so the USers can inherit all privis specified by a Role

*  PUBLIC Role is special role that every User automatically has.
* Public Role cannot be granted to/revoked from user
* DBA can grant any privils into Public so users can have those by default.

* Roles can be local to a PDB or common to all

CREATE ROLE role_name
	IDENTIFIED BY password | NOT IDENTIFIED
	CONAINER = [CURRENT | ALL];

GRANT role|privi [role, privi,...]
	TO [user | role | PUBLIC] [program_unit_type program_unit_name...]
	[WITH ADMIN OPTION]
	[CONTAINER = CURRENT|ALL] ;

DROP ROLE role_name;

* Oracle Codes:
CREATE ROLE developer;
GRANT CREATE SESSION, CREATE SEQUENCE, CREATE TABLE TO developer;
SELECT * FROM dba_sys_privs WHERE GRANTEE = 'DEVELOPER';
SELECT * FROM dba_sys_privs WHERE GRANTEE = 'TEMP_USER';
GRANT developer TO temp_user;

CREATE SEQUENCE temp_seq;
SELECT * FROM user_role_privs;
SELECT * FROM 	session_privs;
CREATE SYNONYM temp_synonym FOR temp_table;
GRANT CREATE SESSION, CREATE SEQUENCE, CREATE TABLE, CREATE SYNONYM TO developer;
GRANT CREATE SYNONYM TO developer;

CREATE ROLE test_role IDENTIFIED BY 123;
GRANT test_role TO temp_user;
GRANT SELECT ANY TABLE TO test_role;

SET ROLE test_role IDENTIFIED BY 123;
SET ROLE ALL;
SET ROLE test_role IDENTIFIED BY 123, developer;
SET ROLE NONE;
SET ROLE ALL EXCEPT test_role;

SELECT * FROM hr.employees;
DROP ROLE test_role;

ALTER USER user_name
	DEFAULT ROLE role_name | [role_name,...]
	| ALL [EXCEPT role_name]
	| NONE;

*** To checl Roles
SELECT *
